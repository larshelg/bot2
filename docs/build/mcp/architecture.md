# System Architecture

## Overview

Our system follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Components

### API Gateway
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and request throttling

### User Service
- User management and authentication
- Profile data and preferences
- OAuth integration

### Data Service
- Database operations
- Data validation and transformation
- Caching layer

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis cache
- **API**: RESTful APIs with GraphQL for complex queries
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on Kubernetes

## Data Flow

1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. Gateway validates authentication
3. Request routed to appropriate microservice
4. Service processes request and returns response
5. Gateway returns response to client
